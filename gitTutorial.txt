Here is how to upload files to github

ADD
git add <filename>

To add a new file to the git repository you need to add it first.
You only need to do this once for each file.

COMMIT
git commit -m <message>

This command will commit any changes made in any files to your local repository (NOT ONLINE git repository)
The message should be about what changes you have made in the files.

PUSH
git push
This will push your changes to the online git repository. You do this after you have committed them on your local repository first. If your local repository is not up-to-date with the latest changes from the online repository (missing or outdates files) then github will not let you push new changes until you've done a git PULL (see below).

PULL
git pull
This will update your local repository with all the newest updates from the online git repository.
